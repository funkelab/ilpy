Welcome to ilpy's documentation!
================================

**ilpy** is a Python library that provides unified wrappers for popular Integer
Linear Programming (ILP) solvers such as Gurobi and SCIP. It offers a
consistent API that abstracts away the differences between solver
implementations.

With ilpy, you can:

* Define linear and quadratic optimization problems using a simple, intuitive syntax
* Express constraints using natural Python expressions
* Switch between different solver backends (currently Gurobi and SCIP)
* Monitor solver progress through callback events
* Support for continuous, binary, and integer variables
