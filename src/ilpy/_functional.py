    """Solve an objective subject to constraints.

    This is a functional interface to the solver. It creates a solver instance
    and sets the objective and constraints, then solves the problem and returns
    the solution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objective : Sequence[float] | Expression | Objective
        The objective to solve.  If a sequence of floats is provided, it is
        interpreted as the coefficients of the objective. For example, the objective
        2x + 3y would be provided as [2, 3].
        Alternatively, an `ilpy.Expression` or `ilpy.Objective` can be provided.
    constraints : Iterable[ConstraintTuple  |  Expression  |  Constraint]
        The constraints to satisfy.  May be provided as a sequence of Expression or
        Constraint objects, or as a sequence of tuples of the form
        (coefficients, relation, value), where coefficients is a sequence of floats,
        relation is an `ilpy.Relation` or a string in {"<=", ">=", "="}, and value is a
        float.  For example, the constraint 2x + 3y <= 5 would be provided as
        `([2, 3], Relation.LessEqual, 5)`.
    sense : Sense | Literal["minimize", "maximize"]
        The sense of the objective, either `Sense.Minimize` or `Sense.Maximize`.
        Alternatively, a string in {"minimize", "maximize"} can be provided.
        By default, `Sense.Minimize`.
    variable_type : VariableType | Literal["continuous", "binary", "integer"]
        The type of the variables, either an `ilpy.VariableType`, or a string in
        {"continuous", "binary", "integer"}.  By default, `VariableType.Continuous`.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Whether to print the solver output, by default False.
    preference : Preference | Literal["any", "cplex", "gurobi", "scip"]
        Backend preference, either an `ilpy.Preference` or a string in
        {"any", "cplex", "gurobi", "scip"}.  By default, `Preference.Any`.
    on_event : Callable[[EventData], None], optional
        A callback function that is called when an event occurs, by default None. The
        callback function should accept a dict which will contain statics about the
        solving or presolving process. You can import `ilpy.EventData` from ilpy and use
        it to provide dict key hints in your IDE, but `EventData` is not available at
        runtime. See SCIP and Gurobi documentation for details what each value means.

        For example

        .. code-block:: python

            import ilpy

            if TYPE_CHECKING:
                from ilpy import EventData


            def callback(data: EventData) -> None:
                if data["backend"] == "gurobi" and data["event_type"] == "MIP":
                    print(data["gap"])


            ilpy.solve(..., on_event=callback)

    Returns
    -------
    Solution
        The solution to the problem.
